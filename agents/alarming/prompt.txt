Key Monitoring Recommendations:

ExtremelyImportantAppServer is the primary workload resource requiring comprehensive monitoring
EBS volume vol-090f075e17318955b should be monitored for performance and capacity
S3 bucket noop-storage should be monitored for access patterns and costs
The Test-Instance is terminated and doesn't require active monitoring
Network traffic and security group changes should be monitored for the active instance
CloudWatch monitoring is currently disabled on the running instance - consider enabling for better observability
